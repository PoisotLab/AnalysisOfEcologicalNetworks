of an observation by ignoring their best judgement, decades of training in
biology, and expertise; instead, we rely on whether some arbitrary value (the
<em>p</em>-value) is lower than some even more arbitrary threshold (0.05). It all seems
very <em>ad hoc</em> (it is). And yet, a surprising amout of literature on ecological
networks attempts to decide whether some observed value of a network measure is
&ldquo;significant&rdquo;, and so it is with great reluctance that we will dedicate a
chapter to this practice.</p><h2 id=fundamentals-of-nhst>Fundamentals of NHST</h2><p>Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) for ecological networks strives to
answer the following question: &ldquo;if I observed the value $f_0$ for the measure
$f$ on a network $\mathbf{N}$, is it in the range of values expected by
chance?". Most often, we want to refine this question by asking if the value is
larger or smaller than we expect, and this is why this process usually involves
a one-tailed one-sample <em>t</em>-test.</p><p>It does so by generating a distribution for the possible values of
$f(\mathbf{N})$. For most measures (all of them, in fact), there is no direct
expression of the distribution of the results, and we need to rely on an
imperfect proxy: generating random networks.</p><h2 id=overview-of-the-nhst-steps>Overview of the NHST steps</h2><h2 id=an-example-using-nestedness>An example using nestedness</h2></section></main><footer><section class=container>Coming soon</section></footer></body></html>
