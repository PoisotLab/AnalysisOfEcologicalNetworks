title: The importance of connectance
---

```julia
using EcologicalNetworks
```

## An overview of the theory

## Preparing the data

For this chapter, we will want to compare simulations of random networks, to the
output of the same analyses on empirical networks. We will work on host-parasite
data

```julia
using Mangal
ds = dataset("ponisio_2017")
networks(ds)
```

## ...

```julia
U = UnipartiteNetwork(rand(Bool, (5,5)))
```

```julia
connectance(U)
```
