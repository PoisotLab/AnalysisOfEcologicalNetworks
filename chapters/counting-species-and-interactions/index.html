importance of thinking about the number of interactions in a network, and about
the number of interactions established by a species within a network. We will
use various examples to introduce the notions of connectance, degree, and
linkage density. This chapter will also (mostly!) serve as an introduction to
<code>EcologicalNetworks</code> and <code>Mangal</code>, which will provide valuable information for
the other chapters.</p><h2 id=link-species-relationships>Link-species relationships</h2><p>We will begin this chapter by looking at the simplest information we can get on
a single network: <em>how many things are there?</em>. Focusing on the basics is useful
for a few reasons. First, it offers a powerful intuition on the structure of
ecological networks, which is going to underpin most of the topics of this
course. Second, this allows exploring some core concepts about how ecological
networks are represented, and how we can look at their components. Finally, this
provides an introduction to the manipulation of network data through
programming. In particular, this section will serve as a short introduction to
the <code>Mangal</code> package to download ecological networks.</p><p>We will load the <code>Mangal</code> package, to get access to a variety of functions
allowing us to get network data from the <a href=http://mangal.io>mangal.io</a> website.
Note that we will not load it with <code>using</code>, but with <code>import</code> - this means that
we will need to preface the name of the functions by <code>Mangal.</code>, to avoid having
a lot of functions with non-specific names in our namespace:</p><pre><code class=language-julia>import Mangal
</code></pre><p>Finally, because we will want to make some visualisations, we will load the
packages for plots:</p><pre><code class=language-julia>using Plots
</code></pre><p>All of these packages have documentations, and it is always a good idea to see
the different options available for the various functions. One way to get a
sense of the functions included in a package, or to get help on these functions,
it to type <code>?[PackageName].</code> in the Julia REPL, and to press Tab to see the
possible functions. This is also a great way to discover functionalities in
packages.</p><h3 id=overview-of-the-data-querying>Overview of the data querying</h3><p>And with this, we are all set to get our first network from the &lt;mangal.io>
database. To illustrate the basic notions, we will work on a pollination
network, which we access by its unique identifier (<code>935</code>). We will see in later
sections how we can get more control over what networks we get.</p><pre><code class=language-julia>first_network = Mangal.network(935)
print(first_network.description)
</code></pre><pre><code>Pollination networks of the Azorean Flores island
</code></pre><p>This object is of the type Mangal.MangalNetwork, and has information about
a network. To see what information is available in any type, we can call
<code>fieldnames</code> on the type. In this case, this would return</p><pre><code class=language-julia>fieldnames(typeof(first_network))
</code></pre><pre><code>(:id, :public, :name, :date, :position, :created, :updated, :user, :descrip
tion, :complete, :dataset)
</code></pre><p>Most of these information are metadata, <em>e.g.</em> the date, spatial position, date
of upload, and a reference. What we do <em>not</em> have is a list of the interactions.
Luckily, we do not yet need a list of interactions, since we are only concerned
with counting them (in due time, we will get the entire information on
interactions). The <code>Mangal</code> package has a method called <code>count</code>, which will
return the number of objects matching a series of queries. For example, we can
get the number of nodes (of type <code>MangalNode</code>) in our network with:</p><pre><code class=language-julia>count(Mangal.MangalNode, first_network)
</code></pre><pre><code>22
</code></pre><p>We can do the same with the number of interactions:</p><pre><code class=language-julia>count(Mangal.MangalInteraction, first_network)
</code></pre><pre><code>30
</code></pre><p>This method is preferable to more complex ones requiring to download all
interactions, because it is a lot faster. As we will see in the following
section, the representation of network data in &lt;mangal.io> is very rich, and if
all we care about is counting things, then we do not need the overhead
associated with retrieving all the data.</p><p>Equipped with the ability to count objects, we can measure the number of species
and interactions in any network. We will now generalize this process a little
bit, and explore the relationship that exists between the number of species and
the number of links in a collection of networks.</p><h3 id=getting-the-data-for-multiple-networks>Getting the data for multiple networks</h3><p>In &lt;mangal.io>, networks are organized in datasets - we will work on a classical
food web analysis dataset, representing interactions in small lakes in the
Adirondack:</p><pre><code class=language-julia>small_lakes_dataset = first(Mangal.datasets(&quot;q&quot; =&gt; &quot;Adirondack&quot;))
</code></pre><pre><code>Mangal.MangalDataset(15, true, &quot;havens_1992&quot;, 2019-02-23T01:47:06, 2019-02-

RL of the attached data&quot;), 3, &quot;Pelagic communities of small lakes and ponds
 of the Adirondack&quot;)
</code></pre><p>To get the networks associated to this dataset, we can use the <code>networks</code>
function, which will give us an array of networks objects. But first, we may
want to know how many networks we will get this way:</p><pre><code class=language-julia>count(Mangal.MangalNetwork, small_lakes_dataset)
</code></pre><pre><code>50
</code></pre><p>The following line will get all of these networks for us:</p><pre><code class=language-julia>small_lakes_networks = Mangal.networks(small_lakes_dataset)
println(&quot;small_lakes_networks contains $(length(small_lakes_networks)) networks&quot;)
</code></pre><pre><code>small_lakes_networks contains 50 networks
</code></pre><p>We will therefore be able to use our collection of 50 networks to see how the number of species and
links are related.</p><h3 id=counting-species-and-interactions>Counting species and interactions</h3><p>From our collection of networks (<code>small_lakes_networks</code>), we want to extract the
number of nodes, and the number of interactions. There are a few ways to do
this, as is always the case with programming tasks. In this case, we will
summarize every network by a <code>Tuple</code> which will contain <code>(S, L)</code>, the number of
species and links. A <code>Tuple</code> is not modifiable, so this is a safe way to collect
data. In addition, tuples of coordinates are usable directly in plots, and this
will simplify the syntax immensely.</p><p>The first way to achieve this is to use a &ldquo;list
comprehension&rdquo;:</p><pre><code class=language-julia>LS_1 = [(count(Mangal.MangalNode, network), count(Mangal.MangalInteraction, network)) for network in small_lakes_networks]
first(LS_1)
</code></pre><pre><code>(26, 60)
</code></pre><p>This is a little bit unwieldy, as this is a long line, and requires to create a
variable (<code>network</code>) only to use inside the loop. Instead, we might want to use
the more readable expression below:</p><pre><code class=language-julia>S = count.(Mangal.MangalNode, small_lakes_networks);
L = count.(Mangal.MangalInteraction, small_lakes_networks);
LS = collect(zip(S,L));
</code></pre><p>This alternative version is easier to parse, and throughout the book we will try
to favor readability over &ldquo;clever&rdquo; code. The <code>LS</code> variable contains
tuples that look like:</p><pre><code class=language-julia>first(LS)
</code></pre><pre><code>(26, 60)
</code></pre><p>The first network in our dataset has 26 species, and 60 interactions.</p><pre><code class=language-julia>p1 = scatter(
  collect(LS),
  lab=&quot;&quot;, legend=:topleft,
  xlabel = &quot;Species&quot;, ylabel = &quot;Links&quot;,
  frame=:grid,
  xlim=(10,100),
  ylim=(10,1000),
  c=:grey, msw=0, alpha=0.5
)
</code></pre><figure><img src=../../static/figures/01_counting_things/01_counting_things_13_1.png></figure><h3 id=theories-for-link-species-scaling>Theories for link-species scaling</h3><h2 id=degree-and-degree-distribution>Degree and degree distribution</h2><p>In the previous section, we focused on the relationship between the number of
species and the number of interactions <em>across</em> networks. It is also very
informative to look at the distribution of interactions <em>across</em> species
<em>within</em> networks - we call the number of interactions that a species has its
&ldquo;degree&rdquo;, and the degree distribution is crucial information about a network.</p><p>To look at the degree and degree distribution, we will need a few packages,
which you have installed during the introduction. Specifically, we will want to
load functions to analyse networks themselves, so we will use
<code>EcologicalNetworks</code>, and we might want to represent the networks, and therefore
will import <code>EcologicalNetworksPlots</code>:</p><pre><code class=language-julia>using EcologicalNetworks
import EcologicalNetworksPlots
</code></pre><h3 id=getting-the-network-data>Getting the network data</h3><p>And with this, we are all set to get our first network (we also briefly
encountered it during the previous section):</p><pre><code class=language-julia>first_network = Mangal.network(935)
print(first_network.description)
</code></pre><pre><code>Pollination networks of the Azorean Flores island
</code></pre><p>As opposed to the previous section, we now want to get a list of interactions
contained in this network:</p><pre><code class=language-julia>first_network_interactions = Mangal.interactions(first_network);
print(&quot;There are $(length(first_network_interactions)) interactions in this network&quot;)
</code></pre><pre><code>There are 30 interactions in this network

simplest by far is to transform (<code>convert</code>) our <code>MangalNetwork</code> object into a
<code>UnipartiteQuantitativeNetwork</code> (which is used by <code>EcologicalNetworks</code>) - this
is done as follows:</p><pre><code class=language-julia>N = convert(UnipartiteQuantitativeNetwork, first_network)
</code></pre><pre><code>22×22 unipartite quantitative ecological network (Float64, Mangal.MangalNod
e) (L: 30)
</code></pre><p>At this point, you are hopefuly familiar with what &ldquo;network&rdquo; means, but may have
some hesitations about the meaning of &ldquo;unipartite&rdquo; and &ldquo;quantitative&rdquo;. <strong>TK</strong></p><p>As a sidenote, we will often adhere to the following convention when naming
networks. <code>N</code> is a unipartite network, <code>B</code> is a bipartite network, and <code>R</code> is a
random network. This is a useful way to get a sense of what we can expect the
variable to contain.</p><p>Speaking of which, we know that this network contains information on
pollination, and pollination networks are bipartite, because they have two
groups of organisms (pollinators and polinized), which we assume do not
establish interactions within the group. We can therefore transform (<code>convert</code>)
our network into its bipartite representation:</p><pre><code class=language-julia>B = convert(BipartiteQuantitativeNetwork, N)
</code></pre><pre><code>12×10 bipartite quantitative ecological network (Float64, Mangal.MangalNode
) (L: 30)
</code></pre><p>If you are not sure that a network can be represented in a bipartite way, you
can always use the check for bipartiteness, which will return <code>true</code> if the
network can be converted.</p><pre><code class=language-julia>EcologicalNetworks.check_bipartiteness(N)
</code></pre><pre><code>true
</code></pre><p>Not to worry, the <code>convert</code> function will fail with an explanation if the
network cannot be transformed into a bipartite one.</p><h3 id=visualizing-the-network>Visualizing the network</h3><p>To get a sense of what the network &ldquo;looks like&rdquo;, we may decide to plot it. We
have imported the <code>EcologicalNetworksPlots</code> package, which comes with a variety
of layouts and other functionalities for this task, and works in conjunction
with <code>Plots</code>. In this example, we will use a spring layout, where nodes are
repelled, and interactions are attracting their nodes.</p><pre><code class=language-julia>I = EcologicalNetworksPlots.initial(EcologicalNetworksPlots.RandomInitialLayout, B)
for step in 1:4000
  EcologicalNetworksPlots.position!(EcologicalNetworksPlots.ForceDirectedLayout(2.5), I, B)
end
plot(I, B, aspectratio=1)
scatter!(I, B, bipartite=true, mc=:lightgrey, msc=:white, msw=2, ms=8)
</code></pre><figure><img src=../../static/figures/01_counting_things/01_counting_things_21_1.png></figure><p>We <em>may</em> decide to do this, but in practice we will often refrain from plotting
networks. Plotting networks is very rarely useful. Depending on the layout, it
is easy to mis-communicate about the structure of the network. Past a certain
number of species and interactions, the plots look like hairballs. Most
importantly, we have a wide variety of quantitative measures that we can apply,
and they will teach us a lot more about the network structure than any plot ever
would. Plotting is marginally useful during explorations, and to illustrate
certain concepts, but should largely be avoided for research purposes. The few
exceptions to this rule will be during the chapters on network comparison,
network motifs, and network modularity.</p><h3 id=counting-species-and-interactions-1>Counting species and interactions</h3><pre><code class=language-julia>richness(B)
