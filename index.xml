The goal of this chapter is to highlight the
importance of thinking about the number of interactions in a network, and about
the number of interactions established by a species within a network. We will
use various examples to introduce the notions of connectance, degree, and
linkage density. This chapter will also (mostly!) serve as an introduction to
&lt;code>EcologicalNetworks&lt;/code> and &lt;code>Mangal&lt;/code>, which will provide valuable information for
the other chapters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Comparing networks</title><link>https://poisotlab.github.io/AnalysisOfEcologicalNetworks/chapters/comparing-networks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poisotlab.github.io/AnalysisOfEcologicalNetworks/chapters/comparing-networks/</guid><description>Comparing ecological networks Goals of this chapter</description></item><item><title>Network motifs</title><link>https://poisotlab.github.io/AnalysisOfEcologicalNetworks/chapters/network-motifs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poisotlab.github.io/AnalysisOfEcologicalNetworks/chapters/network-motifs/</guid><description>Network motifs Goals of this chapter Illustration</description></item><item><title>Nestedness and interaction overlap</title><link>https://poisotlab.github.io/AnalysisOfEcologicalNetworks/chapters/nestedness-and-interaction-overlap/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poisotlab.github.io/AnalysisOfEcologicalNetworks/chapters/nestedness-and-interaction-overlap/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The deeply flawed art of null hypothesis significance testing</title><link>https://poisotlab.github.io/AnalysisOfEcologicalNetworks/chapters/the-deeply-flawed-art-of-null-hypothesis-significance-testing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poisotlab.github.io/AnalysisOfEcologicalNetworks/chapters/the-deeply-flawed-art-of-null-hypothesis-significance-testing/</guid><description>Ecologists, like sadly a great majority of scientists, decide on the worthiness of an observation by ignoring their best judgement, decades of training in biology, and expertise; instead, we rely on whether some arbitrary value (the p-value) is lower than some even more arbitrary threshold (0.05). It all seems very ad hoc (it is). And yet, a surprising amout of literature on ecological networks attempts to decide whether some observed value of a network measure is &amp;ldquo;significant&amp;rdquo;, and so it is with great reluctance that we will dedicate a chapter to this practice.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://poisotlab.github.io/AnalysisOfEcologicalNetworks/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poisotlab.github.io/AnalysisOfEcologicalNetworks/about/</guid><description>This book offers an in-depth introduction to the analysis of ecological networks. By using actual datasets, it covers the core principles of network analysis, and some advanced applications related to network prediction and spatial analysis. This book is built around code and data, to offer immediately applicable insights into how ecological networks should be analyzed.
