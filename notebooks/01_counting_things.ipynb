We will use various examples to\nintroduce the notions of connectance, degree, and linkage density. In addition,\nthis chapter will serve as an introduction to `EcologicalNetworks` and `Mangal`,\nwhich will provide valuable information for the other chapters.\n\n## Link-species relationships\n\nWe will begin this chapter by looking a basic information we can get on a single\nnetwork - this is useful both as an exploration of the concepts, and as an\nintroduction to the ways we can manipulate network data through programming. In\nparticular, this section will serve as a short introduction to the `Mangal`\npackage to download ecological networks dataset.\n\nWe will load the `Mangal` package, to get access to a variety of functions\nallowing us to get network data from the [mangal.io](http://mangal.io) website.\nNote that we will not load it with `using`, but with `import` - this means that\nwe will need to preface the name of the functions by `Mangal.`, to avoid having\na lot of functions with non-specific names in our namespace:"
